* [Frederick Bousson: Unbeatable at Connect 4 with Wearables and Computer Vision](#unbeatable-at-connect-4-with-wearables-and-computer-vision)


# Talks & Workshops

## Unbeatable at Connect 4 with Wearables and Computer Vision by [Frederick Bousson](https://twitter.com/fbousson){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Frederick Bousson" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

The first sessions was held by Frederick Bousson about wearables.

Wearables, which are becoming more and more mainstream, think about smart watches.
However, lots of smart glasses still look like shit.
This is improving, but only recently some better looking smart glasses started to appear like the [Vuzix Blade](https://www.vuzix.com/products/blade-smart-glasses)

This is important, as eyes are very important to transfer information.
(90% of the information on the internet is processed via the eyes)

### Connect 4
Frederick wants to show possible business clients what you can do with a smart glasses, for this he came up with having a smart glasses help you solve [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

This is a solved game, meaning that an algorithm exist which can solve the game for you.
So Frederick went hunting in the open source community and found some Italion code.

This contained an algorithm to calculate Connect Four.

4 years ago somebody added on top of that code visual processing, another person subsequently ported that code to Google Glass.
Nice to see how with open source you have people who build upon each others work.

TODO: add links to the respective repositories

### Image processing
In order to use smart glasses you will need to do some image processing, and since the colours red and yellow are pretty important for Connect Four your logic must be able to reason in colour.

Reasoning in colour is a pain the ass. 

Also lots of the image processing libraries like to reason with BGR

Reasoning in colour is a pain in the ass, especially because [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) uses [BGR](https://www.learnopencv.com/why-does-opencv-use-bgr-color-format/) instead of the more commonly used RGB.
BGR vs RGB, lots of time lost.

When processing an image you will first need to find objects, draw lines and then find the corners to your service can `see` the board.
TODO: add image of this

Data is then mapped into an array which then can be fed to an [Minimax AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) solver.
(TODO: look at sldie about decision)

This solver will use a decision tree and you can define the amount of positions it needs to think ahead.

Alpha-beta pinning: (TODO: check name) optimize if expected results are not good enough, no need to go deeper into the decision tree and cut off some branches to process.

OpenCV is pretty performant, data of an image can be processed in up to 50 milliseconds which is pretty nice.

It is important to be create, as you must pass the information along about how to process the visual information
(TODO: retrieve a quote from the youtube stream)

Lighting is also very important and it can mess up your colour coding.

### Architecture
TODO: retrieve some info about the architecture from the slides

### Other examples of OpenCV
Somebody decided to make a self driving car in GTA V, which is pretty cool as you can see [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)

### Everything is possible
AR/VR can do anything, but that makes you wonder why it is not yet everywhere.

Some of those reasons are 
* What is the business case that you can solve with AR/VR, what is the added value?
* How desirable is the solution, are people willing to wear such a smart glasses.

### Takeaway
The key takeaways of Frederick around image processing are:
* Everything is possible
* Think before you act
* Just do it

An interesting question popped up about what where the biggest difficulties encountered?
* Upgrading versions of OpenCV was painfull, as they switched values around.
* Lack of documentation.
* Not all androids are the same, Frederick is unfortunate to own a Samsung who tends to do bat things with cameras.
* Finding colours is hard.


## Testimonial TVH MyAssetPlanner by [Tom Verelst](https://twitter.com/tomverelst){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Dieter Hubau" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

### TVH

TODO add some logos

TVH is a company which rents out equipment and can provide you with spare parts.

### MyAssetPlanner

Tomorrowland rents 160 machines, which needs more then 300 calls to plan everything.
TVH wanted to improve the customer experience and decided they where going to develop a new application to help with the planning of these assets: MyAssetPlanner was born.

First there was a design sprint by [clockwork](https://clockwork.ordina.be/) in order to come up with a prototype and the most important business needs which needed to be implemented in the solution.
This took about 1 to 2 weeks.

2 months later the first version was delivered into production, which is already in use for about 4 months.


For development the [spotify model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) is used, focussed around:
* autonomous squads
* do it yourself 

The architecture is driven by events and uses [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as backbone, just consume what you need.

Lots of other stuff (TODO: add the image)

The entire CI/CD pipeline is fully automated thanks to [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/).
Allowing a developper to commit a feature which gets deployed to an acceptence environment, as soon as the product owner approves this feature it will be rooled out in to production.

The teams work with Scrum Agile, interesting was about how they handle the sprint review.
Most notably the review scenario: different stakeholders receive a scenario and 1 person of the team is present for assistence.
But the stakeholders themselves must go through the scenario.
This `forces` your stakeholders to work with the application instead of just watching to demo resuling in a ton of feedback.

### What is next
For the moment there are 16, 17 customers using the tool, very soon this will scale up to 5% of all TVH customers, which amounts to 3000.
After that there will be a gradual ramp-up up to 20 000 customers.

Pretty neat.

## Visualizing Mandelbrot fractals using Riff and Spring Cloud Function by [Dieter Hubau](https://twitter.com/dhubau){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Pieter Van Hees" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

After some late nighters

### Abstractions

TODO: add the image

IAAS, CaaS, PaaS, FaaS and SaaS

Less control to more business value.


#### Function as a Service
New on [Pivotal Function Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-function-service)

Open source project, base of Pivotal Function Service
This is Riff, create easily functions and move it to the cloud.

Initially used Zookeeper/Kafka to send messages between functions.

Google came to Pivotal with [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/)
Knative runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Pivotal decided to switch to Knative and remove a lot of boilerplate needed to run Kafka and Zookeeper.

Knative has 4 components:
* Knative Serving: request/reply messages
* Knative Built: autodetect your code and create the required containers and sidecars.
* Knative Event: replaces Kafka and Zookeeper, provides channels and subscriptions.
* 4th Knative block: makes it run really well on Google Cloud.

#### Riff
New version was released 2 weeks ago.

Name comes from the guitar world

Lead is [Mark Fisher](https://www.twitter.com/m_f_)

TODO: retrieve the image about knative and Istio

* github: all is open source
* operators: TODO find explanation on movie
* developpers: make Knative resources
* [Istio](https://istio.io/): is used for sidecars; security, scaling, ...

### Live demo

Get Pods

Lots of different components, this is the unix way: do 1 job and do it good

### Mandelbrot
Most simple function which creates the most complex objects.

You can keep zooming, more calculations the deeper you go.

### The code

For 400 x 400 image we will send a request to the backend to calculate the results for every pixel
160 000, not the most efficient way to do the calculation, but this demo is about using functions.

UserContainer: actual container contains the actual function

InitContainer: they run before your container, you can use these to instantiate a database for example.

Dave Syer, talk about performance [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97UTDmonq7w)

For 1 function you need about 200 MB of memory.
It spins up a Spring Boot in the backend.

### What did we learn
* Not stable - brand new and state of the art
* Contribute - also by reporting issues (TODO add link to the jira/github issue tracker)

## Testimonial: HZIV by [Pieter Van Hees](https://twitter.com/pvanhees91){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Pieter Van Hees" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

### HZIV

TODO: describe HZIV

### What 

10 years ago HZIV wanted to rewrite the old applications running in Cobol.

Chosen technologies were Java 5 and Swing

This rewrite failed

### A new start
Started anew.

Java 8/10
MongoDB
ELK

### Working @ HZIV

#### What is great
Great freedom to choose and test out new steuff
Relaxed

#### What is bad
Developper Anarchy
Some managers like micro-management, this does not combine well with frequent scope changes by the same managers.

#### Why should you want to work here
* Feels like a Spy HQ
* Home made rule engine

## The 10 worst mistakes your Product Owner can make by [Julia Müller](https://twitter.com/JM_AgileAnalyst){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Julia Müller" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

A product owner 
`TODO: retrieve definition product owner from the slides`

### 1. No knowledge of product
Should be able to explain a product in 3 minutes.

Use a [product canvas](https://medium.com/qdivision/the-product-canvas-edf8df531) to help you understand your product.


### 2. Team has no product

Missing context / Lots of scope changes.
=> You need focus.

### 3. There is no vision

It is bad when user stories describe solutions like, `The user needs a button to be able to ... `

Because this causes the team to stop thinking about what would be the best possible solution.
Do not forget, a team of people has more knowledge then 1 individual.

Scrum is developping towards a goal
Scrum is about autonomous teams

The vision must provide direction & guidance.

A postcard from the future [link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/postcards-from-future-agile-technique-ryan-thomas-hewitt)

### 4. The non-economic dreamer

Every feature adds complexity, increases the chance on failure and makes future changes more expensive.

A product owner must be able to reason economically, every feature should add a clear benefit.

Also a product owner should not hide behind "something" the tech team does.
As those "things" also determine the cost / business value of your product.

### 5. Tech Debt not my Problem.

A good technical design is important for the success of your product. 
See [link](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html)

Investing in delivery speed might not add a direct business feature, but will reduce development cost and allow you to provide new features faster in the future.
Customer value is different to business value.
Business value can also be an investment.

### 6. The YES-sayer

Your product becomes a Frankenstein.

It is better to discuss more upfront then to implement features you will need to remove later.

#### Wishfull thinking

Know how to validate your assumptions

Have a good feedback loop.

#### Ignoring the facts

Spring review: user should start the application and use it themselves.

### 7. Obessing over details, being a perfectionist

Huge backlog is not good, a good exercise is to take the top 50 and delete the rest.

In this backlog there is a lot "relevant" information in the stories, however, this tends to become stale.
Also later on it will become increasingly difficult to implement these stories because it is not certain if the information they contain is still correct.

3 Cs 
* Card (post it - fat pen)
* Only Acceptance Criteria on the story.
* Converse: during refinement and then you will expand the story.

Being fast in the market beats having a complete product.

### 8. No pressence or communication

Product Owner must be with the team.

### 9. Crossing competences
`This is not a 13, but it is much smaller` 

If your team says it is a 13, it is a 13.
They have the knowledge to estimate and implement a story.

### 10. Product owner is the only one filling the backlog

Let the team bring their own ideas to the backlog.
This will help them focus and deliver a better solution.

Focus on what matters.

### Questions
#### Product owner has a lot of hats.
The product owner is indeed responsible for a lot of stuff.

But being responsible does not mean that you need to deliver everything yourself, learn to delegate.

The product owner should also not be the only one who meets the stakeholders.

Also, not everybody should have to be a stakeholder.
Learn to remove stakeholders who do not contribute to the business value, remember the Frankenstein.

#### Ignore stakeholders wishes
A Product Owner should be able to take his own decisions and can thus decide to run some tests on customers and collect data.

It is sometimes better to ask for forgiveness later.

If the product owner has no trust of the organization and can not take decisions, that person should not be product owner.

## Deep learning in practice by Remco Runge

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Remco Runge" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

Machine learning: you try to get the good algorithm to find the stuff you want to find.

Deep Learning is based on biology, about how people thought that the brand did function.
The assumption was wrong, but the basic principles still work.

You can define weights on input in order to make certain inputs more important.

Tensorflow has a nice [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)

TODO - add image to describe these 2 flows

Deep learning has 2 flows:
* forward propagation: feed data through it.
* backward propagation: update weights so the next iteration will be better

Deep learning requires a very large network.

### Deep Learning @ Ordina

#### Drone

#### Alpha Go

#### Train stuff

### Questions
#### How long does it take to get started.

If you work with existing data sets and known algorithms, 15 lines of code is enough.

For a brand new project it is easily 55 days just to show that deep learning is possible for a specific business case.
It takes a long time to gather the required data. You need to label it, make sure it is diverse enough so your model is not too focussed on 1 specific subset of input.

## Innovation without asking permission by [Bart Blommaerts](https://twitter.com/DaggieBe){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Bart Blommaerts" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>


### Service decomposition

When you want to split a monolith in smaller applications there are 3 patterns you can follow.

* Split: define vertical functional boundaries, this does not happen to be possible in all old applications.
* Strangle: extract and re-implement
* Extend: new functionality in new microservices, do pay attention to not create a distributed micro-shit fest, also known as a distributed monolith.

Generally you will not just use 1 pattern but all 3.

### Anti-corruption layer

The anti-corruption layer translates to and from different models.
It allows you to enfore loose coupling between contexts.

* Shared repository
* Data-synchronized repository: each microservice 1 database, asynchronously synchronize the data.
* Event driven synchronised repository: the main idea behind events; do not wait for data to be asked but just publish it.

An event happened in the past.

It contains 3 types of data:
- Data it owns
- Data it needs
- Referenced Data
The event should contain enough information so that consumers do not need to query for additional data.

### Bounded contexts

Look at the DDD lite movie from [Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/1431-greg-young-ddd-projects).

After the first view you will decide that you don't want to ever do Domain Driven Design, so make sure to look at it twice ;-)

Identify the domain
* Where does your microservice start? 
  Identify domains and subdomains, these subdomains tend to correspond with your bounded contexts
  
* How?
  Look at the data model
  - Talk to bussiness stakeholders, make this list of subdomains explicit.
  - Look at the data

TODO there was someting about a good book, so look this up in the youtube and add it here

### Demo
Use Avro Schema for you messages, this shared schema repository is then the only coupling.

### API's 
You introduce schema's 
Avro schema's with schema registry

`Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you expect from others` 

### Without asking permission?
Continuous experimentation, introduce that culture.

Use feature toggles and monitor your users.
Make use of traffic routing.
Gather user feedback.

Use this data to convince your stakeholders.

### Distributed systems
Are hard, see the [8 fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)

### Monitoring
Introduce monitor/logging (grafana / prometheus)
This can be displayed to the users

Which can give you new opportunities.
Your business uers will learn about the system.
They will see failures and they want this to be resolved.

### Maintenance

Do not forget to take maintenance into consideration.
Pre-check before adopting some new technology.

Because do not forget that you will still need to maintain it.
